# AI-Fridge Prototype

## Project Overview
In this project, a recommender system that uses object detection to capture the contents of the fridge and provides a list of meals to prepare is developed.

## Installation

To set up the project, there are a number of libraries and datasets that need to be downloaded and installed first.

First, run the "Dependencies" code blocks, followed by the "Download custom dataset". This will ensure that all the necessary files for this project are downloaded. Once all the dependencies and datasets have been downloaded, everything up until data vizualizing can be executed. For data vizualization, custom images have been used. Upload your own custom images and run the vizualisation tests.

For the recommender system, first download the dataset from: https://universe.roboflow.com/greenkitchen/ingredients-u1v6l. Continue executing the code blocks.
